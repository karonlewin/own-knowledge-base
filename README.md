# README

This project is being developed to help on my learning process on different areas. The main objective is to have a place to save my own notes about what I've learned and to review constantly. So every week the app sends an email reminding to review these notes, helping me to build my knowledge and fixate the content learned. The stack is based on Rails, Heroku, SendGrid, and TravisCI.
