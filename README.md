# README

This project is being developed to help in my learning process in different areas like the English language, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, Docker and CI/CD. The main objective is to have a place to save my own notes about what I've learned and to review constantly. So every week the app sends an email reminding to review these notes, helping me to build my knowledge and fixate the content learned. The stack is based on Rails, Heroku, SendGrid, and TravisCI.
